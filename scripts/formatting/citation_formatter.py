This module contains the `CitationFormatter` class, designed to process
AI-generated text containing citation markers (e.g., `[1]`). It detects these
markers, renumbers them sequentially, and appends a formatted list of sources
based on the metadata of the originally cited text chunks, such as sender,
date, and subject for email documents.

class CitationFormatter:
    """
    Handles the post-processing of AI-generated answers to correctly format
    in-text citations and append a corresponding list of sources.

    When an answer from a language model includes citation markers (e.g., `[1]`, `[2]`),
    this class ensures these citations are accurate and properly presented.
    It is initialized with `top_chunks`, which is a list of dictionaries, each
    representing a source document/chunk that the AI might have cited. Each chunk's
    dictionary should contain its metadata and an original `rank` that the AI might
    have used for its initial citation.

    The process involves:
    1.  **Detecting Citations**: The `detect_citations` method finds all numeric
        citation markers (like `[1]`) within the raw answer text.
    2.  **Renumbering and Rewriting**: If citations are found, `build_label_mapping`
        creates a map from the original citation numbers in the text to new,
        sequential, 1-based numbers. `replace_citations_in_text` then updates the
        answer text with these new citation numbers. This ensures citations are
        dense and correctly ordered, especially if the AI's original citations
        were sparse or out of order.
    3.  **Formatting Sources**: The `format_sources` method generates a "Sources:"
        section. It iterates through the remapped citations that actually appear
        in the answer. For each, it retrieves the corresponding original chunk's
        metadata (e.g., Sender, Received date, Subject for emails) from `top_chunks`
        (using the original `rank`) and formats it into a readable source line,
        prefixed with the new citation number.
    4.  **Finalizing Answer**: The `finalize_answer` method orchestrates these steps,
        returning the answer text with updated citations followed by the generated
        sources section. If no citations are detected, the original answer is returned.
