# Section defining various file and directory paths
# IMPORTANT: Update these paths to match your local environment and project structure.
paths:
  # Root directory for all project-related data.
  data_dir: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/DATA"
  # Directory where cleaned email data (e.g., TSV files from Outlook) is stored or will be saved.
  email_dir: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/DATA/emails/cleaned_emails"
  # Base directory to store generated FAISS indexes and associated metadata files for different tasks or datasets.
  embeddings_dir: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/embeddings"
  # Directory for storing log files generated by various pipeline components.
  log_dir: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/DATA/emails/logs"
  # Full path to the primary TSV file containing cleaned email data (often the output of EmailFetcher).
  cleaned_emails: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/DATA/emails/cleaned_emails/cleaned_emails.tsv"
  # Full path to the TSV file where chunked email text (output of TextChunker) will be saved.
  chunked_emails: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/DATA/emails/chunked_emails.tsv"
  # Full path to the main FAISS index file for email chunks. Specific tasks might use different index files.
  faiss_index: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/embeddings/email_chunks.index"
  # Full path to the metadata file corresponding to the main FAISS index.
  metadata_file: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/embeddings/email_chunks_metadata.tsv"
  # Default output filename, potentially used for exported results, reports, or specific task outputs.
  output_file: "Alma_L_365.tsv"

# Settings for fetching emails from a local Microsoft Outlook application.
outlook:
  # The email address or display name of the Outlook account from which to fetch emails.
  # This must match an account configured in your local Outlook client.
  account_name: "hagaybar@tauex.tau.ac.il"
  # The path to the target email folder within Outlook. Use ">" as a separator for subfolders
  # (e.g., "Inbox > Important > Projects").
  folder_path: "LISTS>ALMA L"
  # Number of past days for which to fetch emails. For example, 7 means emails from the last 7 days.
  # days_to_fetch: 3 # Example: Fetch emails from the last 3 days. Uncomment and set your desired value.

# Default operational parameters used by various pipeline components if not overridden by task-specific configurations.
defaults:
  # Default number of top relevant chunks to retrieve during a similarity search in the retrieval phase.
  top_k: 5
  # Default column name in data files (e.g., TSV files) that contains the main text content
  # used for chunking and/or embedding.
  text_column: "Chunk"

# Configuration settings for the text embedding process.
embedding:
  # Mode for generating embeddings:
  # "local": Use a sentence-transformer model running on your local machine.
  # "api": Use an external embedding service via an API (e.g., OpenAI).
  # "batch": Use a batch-processing mode if supported by the API (e.g., OpenAI batch API).
  mode: "local" # or "api"
  # Name or path of the embedding model to use.
  # For "local" mode, this should be a model name compatible with the sentence-transformers library
  # (e.g., "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2").
  # For "api" mode, this should be the model identifier for the specific API
  # (e.g., "text-embedding-ada-002" for OpenAI).
  model_name: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" #
  # The dimensionality of the vector embeddings produced by the chosen model.
  # For example, "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" produces 384-dimensional vectors.
  # OpenAI's "text-embedding-ada-002" produces 1536-dimensional vectors.
  embedding_dim: 384  # Or 1536 if using OpenAI models
  # Default directory where embedding-related outputs (like the FAISS index and its metadata file)
  # specific to this general configuration will be saved.
  # Note: This path might be overridden by more specific task configurations if used.
  output_dir: "C:/git projects/Rag_Project/embeddings/emails/local_embeddings"
  # Default filename for the FAISS index file.
  index_filename: "chunks.index"
  # Default filename for the metadata TSV file that is associated with the FAISS index.
  # This file typically stores the text chunks and any other relevant metadata corresponding to the embeddings.
  metadata_filename: "chunks_metadata.tsv"
